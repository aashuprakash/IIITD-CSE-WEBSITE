This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

**Adding New Pages**

1. Create a New File: In the /app directory of your Next.js project, create a new folder with the name of the required page. The name of this folder will be used as the route for your new page. For example, if you create a folder named about, the route for this page will be /about. Within the folder, create a page.js and layout.js file.

2. Define a React Component: Each page in Next.js is a React Component. Define a new React Component in the file you created (page.js). For example: export default function About() {return <>About Us</> }

3. Use the Link Component for Navigation: Routing new pages through navigation components (Navbar) is not automated. You must manually add the <Link> component for each new page you create.

4. Test Your New Page: Start the Next.js development server and navigate to your new page to ensure it’s working correctly. You can start the server using npm run dev and then go to http://localhost:3000/about in your browser to see your new page.

5. Deploy Your Changes: Once you’ve tested your new page locally, push the changes to the remote repository, automatically triggering the CI/CD pipeline, and the app will be deployed using Vercel. Note that this repository has been connected to Vercel using aryanteng's GitHub account.
